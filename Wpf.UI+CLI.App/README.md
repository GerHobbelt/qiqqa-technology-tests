# WPF UI & CLI App

## Purpose

To test the viability of a single executable which can work both 
- as a user-facing WPF-based UI application and 
- as a (preferrably silent, no output window!) commandline based tool
depending on whether and what commandline options you feed this animal.

The CLI mode is for batch and scripted operation,
while the **silent CLI** is for running in the background as a worker application 
while feeding back output to a calling application (which may or may not have 
a UI. Think `QiqqaOCR.exe` plus invoker `Qiqqa.exe`.)

## Motto

This here is part of the technical storyboarding side of a UI & UX overhaul of Qiqqa.

Before we put it to Qiqqa, it will be tested here.
