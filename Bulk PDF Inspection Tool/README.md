# WPF+CLI-based Bulk Document Inspection Tool

## Purpose

To discover what sort of trouble we'll still find processing the PDF (test) collections.

Key features which must be supported:

- scan 1 or more directories, recursively, to find all available PDFs
- apply OCR and other choice processes to each of these PDFs and:
  + report results for each
  + compare results with reference data to find toolchain regressions / bugs: if we produce results which differ from the reference, we should be made aware so we can see what and who is wrong.

## Motto

This here is part of the technical storyboarding side of a UI & UX overhaul of Qiqqa.

Before we put it to Qiqqa, it will be tested here.
