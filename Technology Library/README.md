# Qiqqa Technology Shared Library

## Purpose

The collection of sources, classes, etc. which are used by the various Technology Test/Demo Applications.

Not a real library as we want to see how this 'Shared Library' approach flies when done from scratch and new applications. This is our second time with this type of project, after we tried it on the existing Qiqqa codebase a while ago, which was NOT a success. 
Anyway, we should give this another twirl and see how it flies under the new, slightly different, conditions...

## Motto

This here is part of the technical storyboarding side of a UI & UX overhaul of Qiqqa.

Before we put it to Qiqqa, it will be tested here.
