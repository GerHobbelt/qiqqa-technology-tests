# WPF UI Look  & Feel Demo (with Theming)

## Purpose

To test the viability of integrating a UI design framework like MahApps and add-ons such as Dragablz to see 
if and how these cooperate with CEFSharp browser controls and a (light?) MVVM framework.



---

## Motto

This here is part of the technical storyboarding side of a UI & UX overhaul of Qiqqa.

Before we put it to Qiqqa, it will be tested here.
