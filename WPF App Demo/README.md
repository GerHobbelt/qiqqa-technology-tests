The purpose of this 'demo' is to test WPF catastrophic crashes we are experiencing in the Qiqqa application and investigate whether it's Microsoft's WPF itself to blame or a second party that may be involved -- Qiqqa is regrettably (or rather disasterously, I'd say, for that effin' crap has cost me several weeks of debugging/diagnostics to date (2019 -- Q3 2022)) using commercial closed-source libraries (SynFusion et al).

Anyway, this is merely here to serve as a coding scratchpad for root cause analysis in the large Qiqqa app.

## Obsoleted Project

Reason: we're definitely moving away from .NET, using C/C++ & TypeScript/JavaScript/web technologies for front-end and back-end(s).

While the subject is still relevant there, we'll be either reviving this project or doing our tests elsewhere while we work with the mentioned technologies.
