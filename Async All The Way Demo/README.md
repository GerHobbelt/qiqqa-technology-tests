# WPF-based Async All The Way Demo

## Purpose

See what we need to do to ensure UI responsiveness while employing an ASYNC approach to all activities initiated. May include a MVVM framework to see if that helps the coding / structure.



---

## Motto

This here is part of the technical storyboarding side of a UI & UX overhaul of Qiqqa.

Before we put it to Qiqqa, it will be tested here.

## Obsoleted Project

Reason: we're definitely moving away from .NET, using C/C++ & TypeScript/JavaScript/web technologies for front-end and back-end(s).

While the subject is still relevant there, we'll be either reviving this project or doing our tests elsewhere while we work with the mentioned technologies.
