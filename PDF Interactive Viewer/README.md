# WPF PDF Interactive Viewer

## Purpose

To test the viability of using GhostScript and whatever else it takes to render PDFs to screen *and* read its content streams plus (XMP, ...) metadata.

This tester/demo should include these features:

- show an **overlay**, where we show/mark/select the text in the PDF.
- show PDF annotations: text, drawing, etc.
- view PDF metadata
- view PDF attachments (attached files, ...?)
- discover PDF bookmarks (the Acrobat "Left Side Panel") and use them to jump to the referenced location within the PDF
- discover and show/use PDF links, e.g. TOC lines which link to the appropriate section within the PDF
- discover and use links to external URIs: either report these when clicked or combine this with the CEFBrowser-focused demo and open the referenced URI in an embedded browser View.

## Motto

This here is part of the technical storyboarding side of a UI & UX overhaul of Qiqqa.

Before we put it to Qiqqa, it will be tested here.
