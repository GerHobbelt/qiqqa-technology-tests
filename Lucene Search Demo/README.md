# WPF Lucene Search Demo

## Purpose

To test how best to migrate to the latest Lucene Search Engine.

We should check out what we actually need from Lucene, how we feed it exactly and MAYBE see if we can improve the search data (no idea how yet, but this demo app is there to try these things when they pop up -- until then it's a test for the Lucene operation as-is.)

## Motto

This here is part of the technical storyboarding side of a UI & UX overhaul of Qiqqa.

Before we put it to Qiqqa, it will be tested here.
