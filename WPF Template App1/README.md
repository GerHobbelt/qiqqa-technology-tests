# WPF Sample App

## Purpose

Just me having a gander at the latest Visual Studio template for this.

While I intend to move away from WPF, this is a set of sample projects that I can fiddle with for test rigging and other work on the existing WPF code base.

## Motto

This here is part of the technical storyboarding side of a UI & UX overhaul of Qiqqa.

Before we put it to Qiqqa, it will be tested here.
