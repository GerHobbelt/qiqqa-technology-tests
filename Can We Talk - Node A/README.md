# Can We Talk - Node A

## Purpose

Check viability of *fast* interprocess communication mechanisms, such as Flatbuffer and ZMQ over pipes and (localhost) sockets, when the messages are exchanged between multiple languages:

- C#/.NET
- C/C++
- TypeScript/JavaScript

This is the C#/.NET node and can be considered a 'client' in the client/server concept.

> Though it's also a 'server' for the TypeScript/JavaScript channel...

## Motto

This here is part of the technical storyboarding side of a UI & UX overhaul of Qiqqa.

Before we put it to Qiqqa, it will be tested here.
