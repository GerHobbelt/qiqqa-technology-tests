# WPF Theme Tester / Mixer / Manager Utility

## Purpose

Assuming we're going to run with MahApps and friends, I want an app where I can test themeing/accenting and validate/test that stuff.



---

## Motto

This here is part of the technical storyboarding side of a UI & UX overhaul of Qiqqa.

Before we put it to Qiqqa, it will be tested here.




---

## Update

Great idea but WPF is a horror to work with, so this will happen when we have moved the entire kaboodle to HTML+CSS. Nuked the WPF/C# files here, until then.
